Currently there is no standardized data format for storing electrophysiological data. This standard is necessary for the improvement of sharing capability. This master thesis deals with the adjustments of data and metadata model for measured data from Electroencephalography and Event-related potentials experiments. The formats for storing electroencephalography data and their ontology were examined. The adjusted file format for export of measured binary data and metadata with experiment details was chosen. Terminology and structure for the experimental metadata were defined. The program that exports the measured data and information about the experiment into the appropriate file format was also implemented.
